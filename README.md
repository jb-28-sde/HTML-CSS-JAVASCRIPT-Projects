A cart quantity project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript typically simulates a shopping cart system for an online store, allowing users to add, remove, and adjust the quantity of products. This kind of project often focuses on understanding core functionalities without relying on external libraries or frameworks. 

An example implementation would include a layout composed of product cards displaying essential information like images, titles, descriptions, prices, and quantity controls. Users can interact with buttons to increment or decrement item quantities and remove items from their cart, which updates the total cost dynamically. The project also involves saving the current cart state in local storage to allow users to resume their shopping without losing their selections.

The key components of such a project include:

1. **HTML Structure**: Setting up the main layout with product listings and the shopping cart area.
2. **CSS Styling**: Designing an appealing user interface to enhance user experience.
3. **JavaScript Logic**: Implementing functions for adding items to the cart, updating quantities, calculating totals, and handling local storage operations to persist cart data across sessions.

This project serves as both a practical coding exercise and a foundational step for building more complex e-commerce applications, making it an excellent choice for developers looking to enhance their front-end skills
